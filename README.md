# Portfolio
My Name is Damilola (DAM-E-LOLA) Akinwale. I enjoy building soft things, I use technology to solve problems. I connect well with people, I speak technology and understand business. I have done this for people and companies in several industries such as Financial Services, Technology, Entertainment, Health Care, Government Agencies. 
The portfolio highlights some of my statistics and machine learning focused work.

I would be interested in having a discussion around opportunities. Thank you for taking the time.



#### Project- 1: The Power of Alternate Data and Asking the Right Questions:  [Project Files here](https://github.com/Daa7314/netflix)
The Netflix  insight project began as a thesis to explore how much undisclosed information can be extracted from a given dataset. Netflix is known for being guarded about its operational data, making it an ideal candidate for this type of research.

Using publicly available datasets and basic statistical analytics. I extracted significant insights and built forecasts about Netflix's operations, including: 
- A predictive model for forecasting subscriber numbers.
- Forecasting video growth trends.
- Identifying engaging content types.
- Predicting cloud storage costs for the entire library.

At the conclusion of the exercise, I deemed that other than the inherent value of data, data's value can be extended based on the type of questions that are posed by the analyst.

#### Project- 2: Natural Langugae Processing: Use Case and Relevance: [Project Files here](https://github.com/Daa7314/cv_Eval)
Natural Language Processing:

My interest in natural language processing was sparked by watching a TV show where an expert guessed the educational level of a ransom note author by analyzing the text's punctuation, capitalization, and grammar. I have since learned to use various Python packages and libraries to perform tasks of interest to businesses:

- Insight Generation From Customer Feedback: I reviewed a fashion website's customer responses, 23 million total. Using spacy, NLTK and a few other libraries and models. I classified it by sentiment and complexity. Generating more datasets that can be used for further analysis.

- Document Simialrity Evaluation: Using streamlit (A python package for deploying ML projects) I created a function that takes in two files, scores them based on similarity and returns a file containing words that are missing when compared with a target document.
