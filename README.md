### Project- 1: The Power of Alternate Data and Asking the Right Questions:
The Netflix  insight project began as a thesis to explore how much undisclosed information can be extracted from a given dataset. Netflix is known for being guarded about its operational data, making it an ideal candidate for this type of research.

Using publicly available datasets and basic statistical analytics. I extracted significant insights and built forecasts about Netflix's operations, including: 
- A predictive model for forecasting subscriber numbers.
- Forecasting video growth trends.
- Identifying engaging content types.
- Predicting cloud storage costs for the entire library.

At the conclusion of the exercise, I deemed that other than the inherent value of data, data's value can be extended based on the type of questions that are posed by the analyst.
